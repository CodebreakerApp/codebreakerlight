If you're interested in helping with the bigger Codebreaker repository, let's get in contact. The bigger repository contains a bot which automatically plays games, a live service which makes use of SignalR for real-time communication, gRPC communication, and more. In some months this repo will be made public available as well. While you wait for it, enjoy this smaller one.
